As modern cloud systems are becoming larger and increasingly complex, offering more computing power and services, they are becoming harder to manage and to maintain. Automatic and accurate detection of anomalies is crucial in order to ensure the reliability, security and safe operation of a cloud system. System logs are the primary source for troubleshooting.  Recent studies focused on inflexible approaches, which are unable to learn semantically meaningful representations of logs, leading to an insufficient generalisation, which is necessary due to the evolution of logs through version updates and changing environments. This work proposes a model which utilises language models in order to capture the linguistic nature of system log data and extract log vector representations and use them in a Bi-LSTM model for anomaly detection. Several experiments on cloud system logs are performed, evaluating different language models which produce numerical log representations, including Bert, GPT-2 and XL-Transformers. Evaluations are performed on the robustness by injecting various alterations, thus simulating a new dataset. The results show that the log vector representations from language models can achieve a high performance and are robust to semantic alterations.
