As modern cloud systems are becoming larger and increasingly complex, offering more and more computing power and services, they are becoming harder to manage and to maintain. Automatic detection of anomalies in system logs is crucial in order to ensure the reliability and security of a cloud system. While recent studies focused on inflexible solutions which are non-portable, due to their inability to learn, this work proposes a model, through which
